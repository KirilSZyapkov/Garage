# Garage

Write a function that stores cars in garages. You will be given an array of strings. Each string will contain number of a garage and info about a car. You have to store the car (with its info) in the given garage. The info about the car will be in the format "{key}: {value}, {key}: {value}…". If the garage does not exist, create it. The cars will always be unique. At the end print the result ordered by the numbers of the garages (no further sorting required) in the format: 
"Garage № {number}: 
--- {carOneKeyOne} - {carOneValueOne}, {carOneKeyTwo} - {carOneValueTwo}… 
--- {the same for the next car} 
Garage № {number}: …"
